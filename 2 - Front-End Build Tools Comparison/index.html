                    <p>Grunt templating generator. I like this one. Less automated than the others, but because of it I was able to understand what was going on much better.</p>

                    <p><strong>JekyllRB</strong></p>
                    <p>A blog generator, essentially. It's a generator for Yeoman using Grunt and Bower, but it's too encapsulated for me to figure out how the hell it works. Its documentation said it uses Liquid markup. I probably won't be using this one.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="x2">
                    <p><strong>Yo Webapp</strong></p>
                    <p>The most basic Grunt build tool I used, and I could see myself using it for simple pages that didn't require templating or using partials.</p>
                </li>
                <li class="x2">
                    <p><strong>Web Fundamentals</strong></p>
                    <p>Google's answer to the front-end build tools. It's essentially the same as the yo webapp generator, but it uses Gulp instead of Grunt. While Gulp does seem to be a bit more simple, it's newer and doesn't have as many well-created packages for it.</p>
